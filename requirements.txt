Project Overview

The Hate Speech Detection Model is an NLP-based classification system designed to identify and filter hate speech from text. Using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression, the model categorizes text as hateful or non-hateful. It helps improve content moderation on social media platforms and online forums

Functional Requirements

‚úÖ Data Preprocessing ‚Äì Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.‚úÖ Feature Extraction ‚Äì Uses TF-IDF vectorization for transforming text data.‚úÖ Classification Model ‚Äì Implements Logistic Regression for hate speech detection.‚úÖ Performance Evaluation ‚Äì Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.‚úÖ Scalability ‚Äì Can be expanded to support deep learning-based models (LSTMs, Transformers).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Functional Requirements

‚úÖ Efficiency ‚Äì Optimized for fast text processing and classification.‚úÖ Security ‚Äì Ensures responsible AI deployment with bias mitigation techniques.‚úÖ Deployability ‚Äì Can be integrated into APIs or web applications for real-time detection.‚úÖ Compatibility ‚Äì Works with social media and online platforms for moderation.
