<p align="center">
  <b>An AI-powered NLP model to detect and classify hate speech in text using machine learning techniques.</b>
</p>

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Hate Speech Detection Model** is an **NLP-based classification system** designed to filter and identify hate speech in text. The model preprocesses data, applies **TF-IDF vectorization**, and classifies text using **Logistic Regression**. This system enhances online safety by integrating with **social media moderation tools** to prevent harmful content spread.

## ✨ Features
✔️ **Text Preprocessing** – Cleans and normalizes input text 🔍  
✔️ **TF-IDF Vectorization** – Converts text into numerical features 📊  
✔️ **Machine Learning Model** – Uses **Logistic Regression** for classification 🤖  
✔️ **Performance Evaluation** – Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score ✅  
✔️ **Visualization Support** – Displays data insights using **Seaborn & Matplotlib** 📈  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Pandas  
- **Feature Engineering:** TF-IDF Vectorization  
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 📥 Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hate-speech-detection.git
cd hate-speech-detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the hate speech detection script
python hate_speech_model.py
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Provide a **text dataset** containing labeled hate and non-hate speech.  
2. The system **preprocesses text** (removal of stopwords, lemmatization, tokenization).  
3. TF-IDF transforms text into a **numerical format** for model input.  
4. The **Logistic Regression model** classifies text as **hate speech or non-hate speech**.  
5. The results and insights are **visualized** using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
